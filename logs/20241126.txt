In September 1977 Duncan was claimed off waivers by the St. Louis Cardinals and made his major league debut, playing a handful of the remaining games.

Duncan, who was a college teammate of Leon Lee in Sacramento, was selected by the Atlanta Braves as the 10th overall pick of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft. A year later he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles and spent five seasons playing for Orioles-affiliated minor league clubs. In September 1977 Duncan was claimed off waivers by the St. Louis Cardinals and made his major league debut, playing a handful of the remaining games. In the off-season Duncan changed teams again as the Oakland Athletics selected him in the Rule 5 draft. The 1978 season was Duncan\\\'s last in Major League Baseball: he appeared in 104 games of the 1978 season playing mostly third base. Duncan continued to play in the minor leagues until 1980. The obituary of The Sacramento Bee quoted a major league scout who believed that Duncan\\\'s career had been hampered by a broken ankle he suffered early in his minor league career.\', \'chunk_order_index\': 4, \'full_doc_id\': \'doc-6efaf9de8d26744af9b9702e79316978\'}\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Taylor Duncan", "Taylor McDowell Duncan", "Dunc Duncan", "May 12, 1953", "Memphis", "Tennessee", "January 3, 2004", "Asheville", "North Carolina", "American", "Sacramento", "Leon Lee", "Atlanta Braves", "10th overall pick", "1971 Major League Baseball Draft", "Baltimore Orioles", "September 1977", "St. Louis Cardinals", "Oakland Athletics", "Rule 5 draft", "1978 season", "104 games", "third base", "1980", "The Sacramento Bee"]}\n'}]
